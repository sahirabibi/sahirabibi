### Hi there 👋


### The Road So Far: 
  - 👋🏼 Hey, I got started as a researcher in a Health and Nutrition Lab and also had the amazing oppurtunity to work in a robotics lab where we studied octapi and built robot arm models! 🐙
  - 🐍 I decided to self-teach myself python so I could get more involved in wider aspects of research, specifically data science. 
  - 🕹 I built some games in python  and used jupyter notebook + pandas to generate pretty data visualizations from public data found online. I really support data accessibility and creating easy to digest visualizations from often complicated topics is a step towards that!  📊
  - 🎨 It was super fun learning python but I fell in love with the ability to create and build beautiful applications! I am a very creative person and I love CREATING anything I can: stories, fanatasy maps, paintings, still-lifes, and now actual websites for people to use! 🎭  
  - 🖥 I attended the Recurse Center where I met really amazing programmers and continued to learn Python!
  - 👩🏻‍💻 I decided to focus on full-stack development so went ahead and joined General Assembly so I could build a strong foundation in all things development. 

### My Current Affairs:
  - 🔭 I’m currently working on Reads a MERN application for users to create virtual bookclubs and find the latest reads so we can all connect over our love for books. 📚
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced topics in React, Azure, and dabbling a little in Django when I find the time! 
  - 💬 Ask me about Javascript, Python, or React!
